Cycle is a *symbolic* mathematics and modeling library based on expression trees that focuses on *numerical analysis*
and find applications in physics, astronomy, biology, artificial intelligence and many more.

##### Research driven

Cycle's main objective is to help researchers from different areas to design models and build numerical
simulations in a pleasant way, with performance and modularity.

## Getting started

To use cycle, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning and a modern [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) version with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) for the compilation and testing,
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hrkz/cycle && cd cycle

# Start the compilation and download dependencies
$ cargo build
$ cargo test # Run tests (optional)
$ cargo run # Run the interpreter (optional)
```
or with the crate
```toml
[dependencies]
cycle = "0.2.1"
```

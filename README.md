Cycle is a **symbolic** mathematics library based on expression trees that focuses on correct, flexible and **comprehensive** manipulation of mathematical objects. Cycle can be used to study elementary and advanced mathematics, mostly in applied domains. It is in particular well suited for education and research in many areas, including for example physics, astronomy, biology and artificial intelligence.

## Important note

* Cycle is a prototype.
* The API is constantly evolving and substantial changes are expected prior to stable releases (x.0.0).
* Feel free to suggest problems that could help to improve the library and provide realistic use cases.
* Help is welcomed.

## Getting started

An extensive tutorial is currently under construction, but you can still read the [online documentation](https://docs.rs/cycle) for the latest version or browse the sources.

#### Try the [online notebook](https://hrkz.github.io/omega/) running on WebAssembly.

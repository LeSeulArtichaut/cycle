//! Cycle - Mathematical modeling using symbolic trees
//!
//! Cycle is a symbolic mathematics and modeling library based on expression trees that
//! focuses on numerical analysis and find applications in physics, astronomy, biology,
//! artificial intelligence and many more.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! Cycle's main objective is to help researchers from different areas to design models
//! and build numerical simulations in a pleasant way, with performance and modularity.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Import `cycle` in your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! cycle = "0.1.0"
